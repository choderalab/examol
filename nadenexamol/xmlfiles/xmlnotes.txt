#NOTES ON TYPE NAMES
basecarbon    : no residue core carbon with attached hydrogen
basecarbonsite: no residue core carbon where R-groups will attach,
                q=basecarbon+coreH
coreH         : Hydrogen of core, no R-groups
coreC#1R#2    : Core carbon at site #1 away (0 is attached) and #2 R-group.
                Note. site +-2 has combined hydrogen
coreH#1R#2    : Core Hydrogen at site #1 away (0 is attached, so does not
                exist)) and #2 R-group. note: site +-2 does not exist, charge
                is combined with carbon
hydroxylH     : Hydrogen for the hydroxyl R-group
hydroxylO     : Oxygen for the hydroxyl R-group
MeC           : Carbon for the methyl R-group
MeH1          : Hydrogens on the methyl R-group. H1 type since C is attached
                to e- withdrawing group
MeEtC1        : Methyl (1st) carbon (core - MeC - EtC) of the ethyl R-group, 2
                attached hydrogens
MeEtC2        : Ethyl (2nd) carbon (core - MeC - EtC) of the ethyl R-group, 3
                attached hydrogens
MeEtH1        : Hydrogens on the first carbon (MeEtC1) of the Ethyl R-group.
                H1 since its attached to an e- withdrawing group
MeEtHC        : Hydrogens on the second carbon (MeEtC2) of the Ethyl R-group.
                Standard aliphatic hydrogen
aminoN        : Nitrogen of amino R-group
nitrogenN     : Hydrogens of the amino R-group
bromine       : Bromine R-group
fluorine      : Fluorine R-group
phenylC2      : Biphenyl is 2 benzene rings connected at effectivley C0.
                However, the Core has other attachment points which still uses 
                q= q(C2) + q(H2), where as THIS carbon (phenylC2) still has a 
                hydrogen, so it needs its own charge.
phenylH2      : Hydrogen on C+-2 from attached point of phenyl group, see
                phenylC2 explination above
nitroN        : Nitrogen of nitro- R-group
nitroO        : Oxygen of nitro- R-group
etherO        : Ether oyxgen on Phenyl Allyl Ether (PAE)
PAEC1         : First carbon in PAE R group. (core-O-PAEC1-PAEC2=PAEC3).
                Alkane
PAEC2         : Second carbon in PAE R-group. Alkene
PAEC3         : Third (and terminal) carbon in PAE R-group. Alkene
PAEC1H        : Hydrogens on first PAE carbon
PAEC2H        : Hydrogen on second PAE carbon
PAEC3H        : Hydrogens on thrid PAE carbon
